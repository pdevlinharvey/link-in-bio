# Link in Bio Project

* In this project I used HTML and internal CSS to create a "link tree" style website to direct users to various social media accounts and links of interest. 

* Included is my profile picture, linkedin profile, github profile, a link to play chess, a link to learn about cryptogprahy, and a link to one of my favorite podcasts. 

* This website is hosted by [Render.com](https://render.com/)
